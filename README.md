# Tic Tac Toe

## Background

This is a challenge from [Advent of Vue](https://adventofvue.com/).

## Introduction

In Tic Tac Toe, two players take turns and place their symbols (ie. a circle and a cross) on a board, which consists of three rows with three cells each. The first person to fill a row, or a column, or a diagonal exclusively with their symbol - wins. If nobody manages to do that, the game ends in a draw.
